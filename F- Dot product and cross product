Cross Product of Vectors
The Cross Product a×b of two vectors is another vector that is at right angles to both.
a×b=absin(θ)n^
Where n^ is perpendicular to both the vectors.

 
  Dot product of two vectors
Dot (Scalar) product:
Dot product of two vectors it is the scalar quantity which is a product of the magnitude of vectors and the cosine of the angle between them.
Represented as (⋅) between the vectors.
A⋅B=A B cosθ
θ: angle between vectors

Dot product are uses for 
1.	Checking whether 2 vectors are perpendicular.
2.	Finding work done by a force.
 
cross product are uses for
When we have forces that involve rotation, or turning about a point or an axis.
